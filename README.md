# Pet-Facial-Expression-Detection
Developed a machine learning system to detect pet facial expressions using a dataset of 10,000+ images, achieving 92% accuracy. Utilized CNNs and RNNs with transfer learning for enhanced performance. Integrated audio cues to refine emotion detection. Potential applications in veterinary care and pet-human interactions.


• Collected and annotated 10,000+ pet images from Kaggle, categorizing emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.
• Leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve 92% accuracy in classifying pet facial expressions.
• Demonstrated potential for improving pet-human interaction and veterinary care through accurate emotion recognition.
